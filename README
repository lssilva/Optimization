This project aims at producing an user-friendly optimization algorithm, inspired from existing Search-Based Algorithms (SBA) like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Hill Climbing (HC) and others. The outcome is expected to be an algorithm which relies on common processes in SBA like mutations, combinations, exploration vs. convergence, and so on. A particular focus is to make it user-friendly, by avoiding parameters which relates more to the algorithm than the problem to optimize, and to make it efficient by exploiting what have been learned from current SBA techniques.
